    "body": "Once you have downloaded the source code,you can build Lite XL yourself using Meson. In addition, the build-packages. sh script can be used to compile Lite XL andcreate an OS-specific package for Linux, Windows or macOS. The following libraries are required:  freetype2 SDL2The following libraries are optional:  libagg Lua 5. 2If they are not found, they will be downloaded and compiled by Meson. Otherwise, if they are present, they will be used to compile Lite XL. Build Script: If you compile Lite XL yourself,it is recommended to use the script build-packages. sh: bash build-packages. sh &lt;arch&gt;The script will run Meson and create a zip file with the application or,for linux, a tar compressed archive. Lite XL can be easily installed by unpacking the archive in any directory of your choice. On Windows two packages will be created, one called “portable” using the “data”folder next to the executable and the other one using a unix-like file layout. Both packages works correctly. The one with unix-like file layout is meantfor people using a unix-like shell and the command line. Please note that there aren’t any hard-coded directories in the executable,so that the package can be extracted and used in any directory. Portable: When performing the meson setup command you may enable the -Dportable=trueoption to specify whether files should be installed as in a portable application. If portable is enabled, Lite XL is built to use a data directory placed nextto the executable. Otherwise, Lite XL will use unix-like directory locations. In this case, the data directory will be $prefix/share/lite-xland the executable will be located in $prefix/bin. $prefix is determined when the application starts as a directory such that$prefix/bin corresponds to the location of the executable. The user directory does not depend on the portable option and will always be$HOME/. config/lite-xl. $HOME is determined from the corresponding environment variable. As a special case on Windows the variable $USERPROFILE will be used instead. Linux: On Debian-based systems the required libraries and Meson can be installedusing the following commands: # To install the required libraries:sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev libsdl2-dev# To install Meson:sudo apt install meson# or pip3 install --user mesonTo build Lite XL with Meson the commands below can be used: meson setup --buildtype=release --prefix &lt;prefix&gt; buildmeson compile -C buildDESTDIR= $(pwd)/lite-xl  meson install --skip-subprojects -C buildwhere &lt;prefix&gt; depends on the OS you are using:  on Linux is /usr on macOS application bundle can be  /Lite XL. app If you are using a version of Meson below 0. 54you need to use diffent commands to compile and install: meson setup --buildtype=release buildninja -C buildninja -C build installmacOS: macOS is fully supported and a notarized app disk image is provided in therelease page. In addition the application can be compiled usingthe generic instructions given above. Windows MSYS2: The build environment chosen for Lite XL on Windows is MSYS2. Follow the install instructions in the link.  Open MinGW 64-bit or MinGW 32-bit shell from the start menu.  Update the MSYS2 installation with pacman -Syu Restart the shell Install the dependencies:pacman -S \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-freetype \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gcc \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-ninja \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-pcre2 \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-pkg-config \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-python-pip \ ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-SDL2pip3 install meson${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX} expands either to mingw-w64-i686 or mingw-w64-x86_64depending if the current shell is 32 or 64 bit.

    "body": "Currently, Lite XL offers a lot of features out of the box. Cross-Platform: We currently support Windows, Linux and MacOS (with Retina display support). Lightweight: We are currently around 3MB in size and takes about 10MB in RAM (can be lower). No Electron / WebView involved. The whole thing is just Lua running on a rendering engine. Extensible: While the editor is minimal by default, it is very extensible using Lua. In fact, a lot of features are provided by plugins. For example, VSC-like intellisense Better font rendering: The editor looks good in screen of any sizes. Some other options are also configurable, such as hinting and antialiasing. Multi-cursor editing: You can now place multiple cursors by CTRL clicking on lines or CTRL+UP/DOWN. Here are some features that aren’t implemented with the rationales behind it. Some of these may be implemented via plugins. We encourage you to give it a shot. Hardware accelerated rendering: tl;dr - franko stated that he isn’t considering using OpenGL due to the skills and work involved. Hardware acceleration was brought up in this discussion. Takase had made 2 attempts at this - at first using NanoVG and then forcing SDL to use GPU rendering. In both attempts, the performance gains at best is negligible, while at worst its completely unusable. Right now, we decided to focus on optimizing the software renderer and various part of Lua code. System fonts: This is painful because various systems has their own mechanism of managing fonts. For now, users can use the fontconfig plugin. Fontconfig is widely available on Linux and installable on MacOS, while Windows builds are available. In the future, we might consider adding API to read font metadata, allowing us to write a fontconfig alternative in Lua. (no promises here) Opening UNC paths on Windows (network drives, accessing WSL2 files from Windows): Our path handling code can only handle POSIX and Windows paths. We also aren’t sure how Lite XL will behave in these scenarios. Inter-window communication (dragging tabs between windows and other magic): This is by far the hardest to achieve. Lite XL has no intention to link to any widget toolkits (Qt and GTK) which are required for these features. An alternative approach is to create our own IPC mechanism, but that’s reinventing the wheel. Integrated terminal: A terminal is complex to implement. There are projects that can be ported to Lua, such as xterm. js. If someone is interested, they can do so. "

What does the plugin do?: The plugin displays a message (that is taken as input from the user) at the topright corner of the editor window. It also allows the user to togglethe visibility of the message. Format of the tutorial: The code contains comments detailing what most (if not all)of the code in the file does. The code :: -- mod-version:1 -- lite-xl 1. 16------------------------------------------------------------------------- NAME    : Simple-- DESCRIPTION: A simple guide on how to make your first Lite XL plugin-- AUTHOR   : Ashwin Godbole (aelobdog)-- GOALS   : To render some text inside the editor------------------------------------------------------------------------- Disclaimer :-- I am not a lua developer, and my knowledge about writing plugins for-- Lite XL is very limited. This file serves the purpose of helping the-- reader get started with plugin development for Lite XL, and therefore-- demonstrates only some very basic features. For more complex plugin-- development, be sure to check out the source code of some other-- plugins after going through this file. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Before we start writing any code for the plugin, we must import the-- required modules from the  core  package. -- the  core  modulelocal core = require  core -- the  command  module will help us register commands for our plugin. local command = require  core. command -- the  style  module will allow us to use default styling optionslocal style = require  core. style -- the  config  module will be used to store certain things like colors-- and functionslocal config = require  core. config -- the  keymap  module will allow us to set keybindings for our commandslocal keymap = require  core. keymap ------------------------------------------------------------------------- colors are just three comma separated values (RGB) (range 0 - 255)-- put inside of '{ }'. We will add our color to the config module. config. text_color = {200, 140, 220}------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let's create a function to calculate the coordinates of our text. -- While we're at it, let's add out function to the `config` module. -- We'll take the message we want to display as the argument to the-- function to determine the x and y coordinates of the text. function config. get_text_coordinates(message)  -- For this plugin, we want to display the text on the top right  -- corner of the screen. For this, we need to know the editor's width  -- and height.  -- The current font's size can be obtained from the  style  module.  -- The editor's dimensions can be obtained by  --  1. WIDTH : core. root_view. size. x  --  2. HEIGHT : core. root_view. size. y  local message_width = style. code_font:get_width(message. .    )  local font_height = style. code_font:get_size()  local x = core. root_view. size. x - message_width  local y = font_height / 2  return x, yend------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let's now get to actually drawing the text inside the editor. -- The first thing we'll do is override the `parent` draw function from-- `core. root_view`. We'll call it `parent_draw` for the time being. local parent_draw = core. root_view. draw-- Now let's overload the original definition of `draw` in the-- `core. root_view` module by redefining the function in the core module. core. root_view. draw = function(. . . )  -- We call the parent's function to keep the editor functional. . .  -- obviously we must still draw all the other stuff !  -- So we call the `parent_draw` function before doing anything else.  parent_draw(. . . )  -- we'll add an option to toggle the message on and off. let's use a  -- boolean variable to keep track of whether we want to display the  -- message or not.  if config. show_my_message then   -- We'll be getting the message to display as input from the user   -- later. We'll store that user input in `config. hw_message`.    -- (NOTE: this variable does not come in-built in lite-xl;   --    it is a variable that we will create later. )   -- let's store the value of config. hw_message in a local variable   -- `message` in case config. hw_message we set the message to   --  message not set yet!    local message   if config. hw_message then	 message = config. hw_message   else	 message =  Message not set yet !    end   -- let's get the coordinates for our text   local x, y = config. get_text_coordinates(message)   -- let's finally draw the text to the window !   -- the draw_text function from `renderer` is an important function   -- as it is used to display any and all text inside of the editor   -- window   renderer. draw_text(style. code_font, message, x, y, config. text_color)  endend------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let's allow the user to turn the message on and off-- we'll write a function to flip our  show  boolean variable. local function toggle_helloworld()  config. show_my_message = not config. show_my_messageend------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, let's add the toggle function to the command list so that-- we can call it from the C-S-p command panel. Let's add one command-- to toggle the visibility of the message on and off and one to get-- the user's message and then display it. command. add(nil, {  -- Toggle the visibility of the message  [ simple:toggle ] = toggle_helloworld,  -- Set and show the message  -- This is the way to get user input through the command bar.  -- `core. command_view:enter` takes 2 arguments:  --  * the prompt to display before taking input  --  * a function that takes the  input  as its argument  -- (NOTE: here the variable we are reading input into is `text`)  [ simple:setshow ] = function()   core. command_view:enter( Test to display , function(text)     config. hw_message = text     config. show_my_message = true   end)  end})------------------------------------------------------------------------- Just for fun, let's assign our commands their own keybindings. -- Here, we assign the keybinding the same string(its name) as the one-- that we set while creating the commandkeymap. add {  [ alt+s ] =  simple:setshow ,  [ alt+t ] =  simple:toggle ,}"

    "body": "Overview: Lite XL is a lightweight text editor written mostly in Lua — it aims to providesomething practical, pretty, small and fast, implemented as simply aspossible; easy to modify and extend, or to use without doing either. Lite XL is based on the Lite editor and provide some enhancementswhile remaining generally compatible with it. Getting Started: Lite XL works using a project directory — this is the directory where yourproject’s code and other data resides. To open a specific project directory the directory name can be passedas a command-line argument (. can be passed to use the current directory) orthe directory can be dragged onto either the executable or a running instance. Once started the project directory can be changed using the commandcore:change-project-folder. The command will close all the documentscurrently opened and switch to the new project directory. If you want to open a project directory in a new window the commandcore:open-project-folder will open a new editor window with the selectedproject directory. The main way of opening files in Lite XL is through the core:find-file command— this provides a fuzzy finder over all of the project’s files and can beopened using the ctrl+p shortcut by default. Commands can be run using keyboard shortcuts, or by using the core:find-commandcommand bound to ctrl+shift+p by default. For example, pressingctrl+shift+p and typing newdoc then pressing return would open a newdocument. The current keyboard shortcut for a command can be seen to the rightof the command name on the command finder, thus to find the shortcut for a commandctrl+shift+p can be pressed and the command name typed. User Data Directories: Lite XL uses standard systems user directories; the user data can be found in$HOME/. config/lite-xl on Linux and macOS. On Windows, the variable $USERPROFILE will be used instead of$HOME. User Module: Lite XL can be configured through use of the user module. The user module can beused for changing options in the config module, adding additional key bindings,loading custom color themes, modifying the style or changing any other part ofthe editor to your personal preference. The user module is loaded when the application starts,after the plugins have been loaded. The user module can be modified by running the core:open-user-module commandor otherwise directly opening the $HOME/. config/lite-xl/init. lua file. On Windows, the variable $USERPROFILE will be used instead of$HOME. tl;dr:  Windows: C:\Users\(username)\. config\lite-xl\init. lua MacOS: /Users/(usernmame)/. config/lite-xl/init. lua Linux: /home/(username)/. config/lite-xl/init. luaThese aren’t the exact location, but it gives you an idea where to find. Please note that Lite XL differs from the standard Lite editor for the locationof the user’s module. Project Module: The project module is an optional module which is loaded from the currentproject’s directory when Lite XL is started. Project modules can be useful forthings like adding custom commands for project-specific build systems, orloading project-specific plugins. The project module is loaded when the application starts,after both the plugins and user module have been loaded. The project module can be edited by running the core:open-project-modulecommand — if the module does not exist for the current project when thecommand is run it will be created. Add directories to a project: In addition to the project directories it is possible to add other directoriesusing the command core:add-directory. Once added a directory it will be shown in the tree-view on the left side andthe additional files will be reachable using the ctrl+p command (find file). The additonal files will be also visible when searching across the project. The additional directories can be removed using the command core:remove-directory. When you will open again Lite XL on the same project folder the application willremember your workspace including the additonal project directories. Since version 1. 15 Lite XL does not need a workspace plugin as it is nowbundled with the editor. Create new empty directory: Using the command files:create-directory or control-click in a directory in thetree-view to create a new empty subdirectory. Commands: Commands are used both through the command finder (ctrl+shift+p) andby Lite XL’s keyboard shortcut system. Commands consist of 3 components:  Name — The command name in the form of namespace:action-name, forexample: doc:select-all Predicate — A function that returns true if the command can be ran, forexample, for any document commands the predicate checks whether the activeview is a document Function — The function which performs the command itselfCommands can be added using the command. add function provided by thecore. command module: local core = require  core local command = require  core. command command. add( core. docview , { [ doc:save ] = function()  core. active_view. doc:save()  core. log( Saved '%s', core. active_view. doc. filename) end})Commands can be performed programatically (eg. from another command or by youruser module) by calling the command. perform function after requiring thecommand module: local command = require  core. command command. perform  core:quit Keymap: All keyboard shortcuts are handled by the core. keymap module. A key binding maps a “stroke” (eg. ctrl+q) to one or more commands(eg. core:quit). When the shortcut is pressed Lite XL will iterate each commandassigned to that key and run the predicate function for that command — if thepredicate passes it stops iterating and runs the command. An example of where this used is the default binding of the tab key:  [ tab ] = {  command:complete ,  doc:indent  },When tab is pressed the command:complete command is attempted which will onlysucceed if the command-input at the bottom of the window is active. Otherwisethe doc:indent command is attempted which will only succeed if we have adocument as our active view. A new mapping can be added by your user module as follows: local keymap = require  core. keymap keymap. add { [ ctrl+q ] =  core:quit  }A list of default mappings can be viewed here. Plugins: Plugins in Lite XL are normal lua modules and are treated as such — nocomplicated plugin manager is provided, and, once a plugin is loaded, it is neverexpected be to have to unload itself. To install a plugin simply drop it in the plugins directory in the usermodule directory. When Lite XL starts it will first load the plugins included in the data directoryand will then loads the plugins located in the user module directory. To uninstall a plugin the plugin file can be deleted — any plugin(including those included with the default installation)can be deleted to remove its functionality. If you want to load a plugin only under a certain circumstance (for example,only on a given project) the plugin can be placed somewhere other than theplugins directory so that it is not automatically loaded. The plugin canthen be loaded manually as needed by using the require function. Plugins can be downloaded from the plugins repository. Restarting the editor: If you modifies the user configuration file or some of the Lua implementation filesyou may restart the editor using the command core:restart. All the application will be restarting by keeping the window that is already in use. Color Themes: Colors themes in Lite XL are lua modules which overwrite the color fields ofLite XL’s core. style module. Pre-defined color methods are located in the colors folder in the data directory. Additional color themes can be installed in the user’s directory in a folder namedcolors. A color theme can be set by requiring it in your user module: core. reload_module  colors. winter In the Lite editor the function require is used instead of core. reload_module. In Lite XL core. reload_module should be used to ensure that the color moduleis actually reloaded when saving the user’s configuration file. Color themes can be downloaded from the color themes repository. They are included with Lite XL release packages. "
